## 2. Installation

This project utilizes several dependencies, which can be installed with:

```bash
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

> [!NOTE]
> _The `--shamefully-hoist` flag **is** required._

---

## 3. Usage

Starting the development server on [localhost](http://localhost:3000) can be done with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> _Nuxt will first have to initialise, which can take some time (~20 seconds) before the project structure is loaded and hot-reloading is available._

Running a production build instead can be done with:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```

## 4. Dataset

This project uses a subset of the publicly available ["Data on COVID-19"](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) dataset made by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). Specifically, three measures are derived:

1.  `total_cases` - The total number of cases for a given country.
2.  `people_vaccinated` - The total number of people who recieved at least one dose in a given country.
3.  `total_deaths` - The total count of deaths attributed to Covid-19 in a given country.

This was then merged into the properties of each country in the publicly available [`geo-countries`](https://github.com/datasets/geo-countries) GEOJSON map sourced from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) data.
